Schematic for the Commodore 16 based on the scans at http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/computers/plus4/index.html.

The schematic was produced with [gEDA] gschem.

To produce the `.svg` file, from within gschem:

  1.  Export to `.eps` with: `File`, `Write image...` then choose `Encapsulated Postscript`
  1.  Invoke `eps2svg` from the `geg` package, tested on Ubuntu 18.04
